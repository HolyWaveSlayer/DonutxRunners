					Roughly six months ago, a group of individuals that shared the same passion for cars created a weekly meet that allowed them to share countless memories with food, boba, and their Miatas. They would meet every Monday at 10PM, in the plaza of Cha2O in Artesia. What used to be known as Miata Mondays is now known as DonutxRunners. As each Monday passed, more people joined, expanding the the variation in cars. From Honda EFs, Miatas, and to even a Camry, this group of people continue to share and appreciate the same love they all have for cars. They have strict rules that allow them to get along well with the city's police department. That means no burnouts, no revving, and definitely no negative attitudes. Those that are willing to meet people, willing to share their knowledge, and are willing to appreciate what they drive are more than welcomed. From 10PM to midnight, countless laughs and stories are shared. As soon as midnight strikes, it was time for take off. This is where "DonutxRunners" was derived from. At midnight, all willing to enjoy a late night drive with everyone are asked to join the group in driving to any donut destination that everyone agrees upon. The location most familiar with the group is Seaside Donuts and Bakery in Newport Beach. Despite the chilly beach weather, upon arrival, the memories and laughter continue. Not only does this group have a love and appreciation for cars, but they all share an appreciation for each other's company, which sets them apart from other car groups. We modify cars. We drink boba. We eat donuts.</p>
